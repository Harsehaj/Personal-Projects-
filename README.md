## Predicting restaurant ratings based on a user's preferences

In this project, I created a visualization of restaurant ratings using machine learning and the Yelp academic dataset. 

In this visualization, Berkeley is segmented into regions, where each region is shaded by the predicted rating of the 
restaurant closest to the users preferences (yellow is 5 stars, blue is 1 star). Specifically, the visualization is a Voronoi diagram.
